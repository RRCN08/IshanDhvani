## a brief inquiry into the Assamese language

### Overview

The project aims to redesign a soundscape interface with the Assamese language as a use-case and create an effective visual interface design. The data used in this soundscape design was collected in a raw format and inherent information which was difficult to comprehend from a research project.
In our current fast-paced world, everyone wants information at the tip of their hands as fast as possible. A well designed interface showcases a dataset to be quickly and easily interpretable.
